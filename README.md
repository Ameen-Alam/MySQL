# MySQL

MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on the SQL (Structured Query Language) queries. The MySQL Database Software is a client/server system that consists of a multithreaded SQL server that supports different back ends, several different client programs and libraries, administrative tools, and a wide range of application programming interfaces (APIs). SQL is one of the most popular languages for accessing and managing the records in the table. MySQL is open-source and free software under the GNU license.



### Oracle

Oracle Database (commonly referred to as Oracle DBMS or simply as Oracle) is a multi-model database management system produced and marketed by Oracle Corporation. It is a database commonly used for running online transaction processing (OLTP), data warehousing (DW) and mixed (OLTP & DW) database workloads.



### MS SQL
SQL Server is a database server by Microsoft. The Microsoft relational database management system is a software product which primarily stores and retrieves data requested by other applications.



### Is MySQL better than Oracle?

Oracle is more suited for larger enterprises, while MySQL is used for smaller projects. Out of the two, MySQL is the most popular. Since it's used with WordPress, which is the most popular content management system for blogging and building websites, its use more often than Oracle.

Oracle, meanwhile, uses PL/SQL, or Procedural Language/SQL. Both are different “flavors” or dialects of SQL and both languages have different syntax and capabilities. The main difference between the two languages is how they handle variables, stored procedures, and built-in functions.
